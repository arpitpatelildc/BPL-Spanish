    "Content": "This activity is to practice the use of definite articles!\n\nEvery noun in Spanish has a definite article. In English, it can be thought of as \"the\" in front of a noun.\n\nThe definite article is defined by the gender and quantity of the word. Here are the possible definite articles:\n\n                      Singular |  Plural\nMasculine |       el       |    los\nFeminine   |       la       |    las\n\nThere are general rules (of course, there are exceptions which you will learn and try to memorize) on how to decide which article is correct!\n\n- If the noun ends in \"-o,\" it is most likely masculine.\n\n- If the noun ends in an accented vowel, it is most likely masculine\n\n- If the noun ends in \"-or,\" it is most likely masculine\n\n- If the noun ends in \"-aje,\" it is most likely masculine\n\n- If the noun ends in \"-a,\" it is most likely feminine.\n\n- If the noun ends in \"-ción\" or \"-sión,\" it is most likely feminine\n\n- If the noun ends in \"-ía,\" it is most likely feminine\n\n- If the noun ends in \"-dad,\" it is most likely feminine\n\nJust like in English, a noun is in the plural form when there is an \"s\" or \"es\" added to the end of the singular form (you will learn plurals in your next activity!)\n\nThis activity is in a Multiple Choice format where you will be presented with a noun and you will choose the correct article for it from the choices provided.\n\nDefinite articles are used as the base of sentence structure as verbs and adjectives follow their form, so learning these will help you in constructing sentences soon!\n\nNow you're ready to learn!

Remove the \"s\" or \"es\" at the end of the word. Knowing the vocabulary will help in converting back to the singular form.\n\nThis activity is in a Multiple Choice format where you are presented with a noun in singular or plural form and you will choose the answer that is the correct version of the other form.\n\nNow you're ready to learn!

The final context in which we can use \"ser\" is when we're expressing origin and nationality, such as saying \"She is American\" or \"He is Canadian\". This activity will use multiple choice to help you practice using this new skill. The Multiple Choice will give you a series of sentences, and it will be your task to choose the grammatically correct version of the sentence.\n\nBefore you start, here is some grammar that will be useful to know:\n\nTo describe someone's origin/nationality, we use the sentence structure (subject) (ser conjugation) (adjective), where the adjective is the person's origen/nationality.\n\nFor example, we can look at the sentence \"Yo soy cubano.\".\n\"Yo\" is the subject.\n\"soy\" is the corresponding ser conjugation.\n\"cubano\" is the origin/nationality (which is written in the correct form to match the subject).\n\nNow you're ready to learn!
